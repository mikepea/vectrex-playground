Vectrex Playground
==================

Holy moly, I'm learning 6809 assembler so I can noodle with my Vectrex.

This is mostly a Vagrant dev box based around Ubuntu Trusty and the linux assembler from
http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/assemblers/

... and the asm files from the chrissalo tutorials, converted to work with
as09_142 (which doesn't support uppercase mnemonics anymore)
