<p class="i1">At the beginning of Vectrex development, a 6502&#160;microprocessor was considered for a short period of time.  I believe that 
the&#160;6502 was suggested because of its very low cost and the fact that we already had a team with&#160;6502 experience.  Those with&#160;6502 
experience were working on Project Breaker - an effort to reverse-engineer the Atari&#160;2600.</p>

<p class="i1">Breaker consisted of looking at the binary code from a 2600 VCS cartridge, identifying what was machine code versus binary data and then 
disassembling the machine code - all by hand.  Since we were going to create original games, it was only necessary to examine the games to the point 
where we understood what the hardware was doing.</p>

<p class="i1">We would step through the machine code to see what it did and how it affected the hardware.  We would typically see a&#160;6502 register 
being loaded with a value, maybe some kind of logical operation followed by a write to an unknown hardware port.  The question would become what was 
important about the individual bits of the resulting value and what did that port do when written?</p>

<p class="i1">The Breaker team consisted of Mark Indictor, Paul Allen Newell and myself.</p>

<p class="i1">Mark began the Breaker effort and was joined by Paul well before I was hired.  By the time I began, the two of them had accomplished much 
of the analysis.  Given the short amount of time for Breaker, the amount of work that they had accomplished was very impressive.</p>

<p class="i1">Once we got the go ahead for Vectrex, we changed gears and boxed-up the Breaker stuff, literally put it on the shelf and shifted our focus 
to the design of Vectrex.</p>

<p class="i1">As the design of Vectrex progressed, it was quickly decided that the&#160;6502 would not be fast enough.  One aspect of 'speed' was the 
clock rate - I believe a&#160;1&#160;Mhz&#160;clock was used for the&#160;6502 and&#160;1.5&#160;Mhz for the&#160;6809.  More important than clock rate 
was the architecture and instruction set of the&#160;6809.  The&#160;6502 had a relatively primitive instruction set where doing fundamental things like 
indexing could be quite awkward.</p>

<p class="i1">The 6809 was a vast improvement over the&#160;6502, but at many times the cost.  No matter the benefits of the&#160;6809, cost could have 
easily have damned us to the&#160;6502 - and trust me that when writing code for the 6502, it doesn't take long to understand what being damned truly 
means.</p>

<p class="i1">I don't know how the decision was made or who the people were in deciding to switch from the&#160;6502 to the&#160;6809 - but I really 
appreciate that they made a decision driven by technology rather than one were cost was the priority.  Don't get the idea that I'm minimizing the issue 
of cost.  The significantly higher cost of the&#160;6809 meant that more money had to be raised before production could start.  It had to be hard 
decision for everyone involved.</p>
