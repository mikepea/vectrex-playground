<br><p class="i1">Just a comment:</p><ul class="i1">

<li>I wrote the following Dark Tower description for Lee Chaden.

</ul>



<br /><h1 class="ctr">Game Description</h1>

<p class="i1"><u>Object of Game</u></p>

<p class="i2">Ultimately the player is required to unlock the door of the Dark Tower by solving the Riddle of the Keys.  To solve the Riddle, the player 
must find four different keys that are scattered about the forest (or by bribing the Magician) and once in the player's possesion, the Dark Tower must be 
found (located at the centre of the map).</p>

<p class="i2">The keys are Gold, Silver, Bronze and Brass (one other treasure is to be found - the Crystal Crown).</p>


<p class="i1"><u>Start of Game</u></p>

<p class="i2">After selecting the desired game option, the player's warrior appears at a random position within the forest.  The warrior will not appear 
in the Zone of Death or near the map boundaries.</p>

<p class="i2">The player starts each game (independent of game option) with 2 bags of gold and 5 replacement warriors (6 total).</p>

<p class="i2">Options</p>

<p class="i3">1 = Player starts with no keys</p>

<p class="i3">2 = Player starts with the silver key only</p>

<p class="i3">3 = Player starts with the silver and bronze keys</p>

<p class="i3">4 = Player starts with the silver, bronze and brass keys</p>

<p class="i3">When selecting options 2 - 4, the player does not receive points for those keys initially given.</p>


<p class="i1"><u>Forest Sequence</u></p>

<p class="i2">Forest Map and Boundaries</p>

<p class="i3">The forest is derived from a fixed map (the map does not change from one game to another).  The map is laid out as 4 sectors, each 
containing 32 x 32 grid points (nodes).  A node may appear as an object (ie - trees or boxes) or as a game play trigger (ie - scenery fog or plague).  
Any given sector can be identified by its characteristic tree type (the tree types are: elm, pine, lolli-pop and dead trees).</p>

<p class="i3">Note: other types of trees can be inserted within a sector without changing the characteristic tree.</p>

<p class="i3">There are a total of 4,096 objects on the map (64 x 64 nodes) consisting of the following break-down -</p>

<table class="i4">
<tr><td colspan="2"> &#160; </td><td class="ctr"> <br /> <b><u>Total</u></b> </td><td class="ctr"> <b>Dead <br /> <u>Forest</u></b> </td>

<p class="i3">Since the forest map is finite, something had to be done to define the boundaries of the map.  Using a fog to define the boundary, the 
player may not leave the map without first being thrown back into the map (randomly).  The boundary fog differs from the scenery fog in the following 
ways:</p>

<p class="i4">1.  The boundary fog occurs even if the player holds a scout (and the boundary fog does not affect the use-counter of the scout).</p>

<p class="i3">Approaching a border is best indicated by the lack of any trees or objects (this appears the same as entering the Dark Forest).</p>


<p class="i2">Zone of Death</p>

<p class="i3">One entire sector of the map has been set aside for a Zone of Death.  This area is apparent because of the dead trees.  In the Zone of 
Death lies several of the treasure and magician boxes.</p>

<p class="i3">Within the Zone of Death, the plague (scenery or box) occurs with great frequency - therefore, it is only safe to enter the zone with a 
healer in possesion.</p>

<p class="i3">One game play function of the Zone of Death is that it increases the hazard associated with the fog (scenery or box).  During a fog cycle, 
the player has a 25% chance of appearing within the Zone and if not prepared, can lose the game by plague alone.</p>


<p class="i2">Dark Forest</p>

<p class="i3">The Dark Forest is a zone where no trees or objects exist.  There are several of these zones within in the map.  In the largest such zone 
(located at the centre of the map), hides the Dark Tower.  If not careful, the player can be lost in these zones.  Because the zone looks like the 
border, entering one of these zones can be quite exciting for the player who has not learned the ins and outs of the map (because they may be entering a 
border fog).</p>


<p class="i2">Warrior</p>

<p class="i3">While in the forest sequence, a pedometer is displayed at the top of the screen.  This pedometer indicates the number of steps since the 
warrior made his last turn.  Direction of motion is also indicated&#160;(N,&#160;NW, W, SW, S, SE,&#160;E,&#160;NE).</p>

<p class="i3">Under some set of conditions, the warrior may not move.  They are -</p>

<p class="i4">1.  If the warrior is being drawn into or returning from a box or while the box is cycling.</p>

<p class="i4">2.  If the warrior has been killed and awaiting replacement.</p>

<p class="i4">3.  During the Magician sequence.</p>

<p class="i4">4.  During the Brigand sequence, the warrior must stop motion to throw a flamoid.</p>


<p class="i2">Healer</p>

<p class="i3">The healer prevents the fatal effects of the plague (scenery or box).</p>

<p class="i3">A healer is available only from the magician (given enough gold).</p>

<p class="i3">A healer can be used only 4 - 6 times and is then lost.  It may be regained from a magician again if the player has not used all the 
magician boxes and has sufficient gold.</p>


<p class="i2">Scout</p>

<p class="i3">The scout prevents the player from becoming lost during a fog (scenery or box).  A boundary fog is not prevented by the scout, the player 
is lost if trying to cross the border.</p>

<p class="i3">A scout is available only from the magician (given enough gold).</p>

<p class="i3">A scout can be used only 4 - 6 times and is then lost.  It may be regained from a magician again if the player has not used all the 
magician boxes and has sufficient gold.</p>


<p class="i2">Scenery Fog</p>

<p class="i3">Scenery fog is implemented as a mapped game trigger, with no warning (it does appear as a missing tree, but no one is likely to 
notice).</p>
 
<p class="i3">When the scenery fog is triggered, the fog ramps up from the bottom of the screen; the warrior and background are ramped down in intensity.  
At that time, a new position on the map is calculated and the process is reversed so that the player can see his new position within the forest.</p>


<p class="i2">Scenery Plague</p>

<p class="i3">Scenery plague is implemented as a mapped game trigger, with no warning (same as the scenery fog).</p>

<p class="i3">When the scenery plague is triggered, the plague ramps up from the bottom of screen; the warrior breaks up and ramps down in intensity 
until it becomes invisible (a dead player and a replacement is requested).</p>

<p class="i3">Following a scenery plague, subsequent encounters with the scenery plague trigger are inhibited for 25 seconds.  This prevents a lost 
player from stumbling directly into a scenery plague almost immediately following the previous plague (but this does not prevent the player from finding 
a box plague and suffering its full effects).  The scenery plague is also inhibited for the first 25 seconds of the game (so that the player does not get 
hit at the very beginning of the game).</p>


<p class="i2">General Box Behavior</p>

<p class="i3">The player must place the box immediately before the warrior on the screen before it can be opened.  Pressing button #4 causes the box to 
start opening (pressing this button a second time closes the box, so long as the box has not opened completely). The box cannot be opened if the plague 
or fog is cycling or if a tune is pending.</p>

<p class="i3">While a box is cycling, the warrior cannot move.</p>

<p class="i3">All boxes appear alike, there is no clue toward the box contents.  Since the boxes are determined by the map, it becomes very important 
that the player learns to map the forest and keeps track of his progress.  This is the only way in which a player may avoid dangerous boxes.</p>


<p class="i2">Box Fog</p>

<p class="i3">When the box has fully opened, a fog cycle is initiated (similiar  to the scenery fog).</p>


<p class="i2">Box Plague</p>

<p class="i3">When the box has fully opened, a plague cycle is initiated (similiar to the scenery plague).</p>

<p class="i3">The box plague is effected by the plague lock-out timer.</p>


<p class="i2">Do-Nothing Box</p>

<p class="i3">As the name implies, this type of box does nothing.  It merely opens, pauses for a moment and then closes.  I feel that it adds 
anticipation for the player.</p>


<p class="i2">Treasure Box</p>

<p class="i3">This box contains a no-risk treasure for the player and is very rare.  The following treasures are possible for this box -</p>

<p class="i4">Bags of gold (1 - 9 bags, determined randomly)
<br /> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; points = bags of gold  x  100 pts.</p>

<p class="i4">Replacement Warriors (1 - 4 warriors, determined randomly)
<br /> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; points = new warriors  x  100 pts.</p>

<p class="i3">A treasure box can be opened only once per game, subsequent openings will take the player to the brigand sequence (once again, it is 
important for the player to learn how to map the forest).</p>


<p class="i2">Scenery Keys </p>

<p class="i3">In each sector of the map, lies one of the keys necessary to open the Dark Tower.  As with all map objects, these keys are in the same 
position for each game.  The key picked up is determined randomly at the time of the pick up and will vary from game to game.</p>

<p class="i3">After finding one of these keys, the player can pick up the key by walking toward the key.  The player must walk directly to the key to 
pick it up (the player cannot back or turn into the key, but the key may be picked up during a fog or plague).</p>

<p class="i3">Any given key may be picked up once only once per game.  If the key has already been picked up, it leaves a blank spot on the map that 
looks like a plague or fog trigger.</p>

<p class="i3">The actual number of scenery keys depend on the starting option, if the player has selected option #2 - then only three scenery keys are to 
be found in the forest.</p>


<p class="i2">Scenery Gold</p>

<p class="i3">After finding a bag of gold, the player can pick up the bag by walking toward it.  The player must walk directly to the bag to pick it up 
(the player cannot back or turn into the gold, but the gold may be picked up during a fog or plague).</p>

<p class="i3">Any given bag of gold may be picked up once only per game.  If the bag of gold has already been picked up, it leaves a blank spot on the 
map that looks like a plague or fog trigger.</p>


<p class="i2">Inventory Page</p>

<p class="i3">The inventory page reflects the status of player progress -</p>

<p class="i4">Player score</p>

<p class="i4">Number of replacement warriors</p>

<p class="i4">Amount of gold held</p>

<p class="i4">Treasures held</p>

<p class="i3">The inventory page can be requested at any time by depressing button #1.  If a tune is pending, the inventory page is delayed until the 
tune is over.</p>


<p class="i2">Control Definitions</p>

<p class="i3">Joystick   =  Move warrior forward / backward or right / left</p>

<p class="i3">Button #1  =  Inventory page</p>

<p class="i3">Button #2  =  No defined function</p>

<p class="i3">Button #3  =  No defined function</p>

<p class="i3">Button #4  =  Opens the box (the box must be in front of the player)</p>


<p class="i2">Scoring</p>

<p class="i3">See treasure box description</p>

<p class="i4">Scenery Gold Key    = 1000 pts.</p>

<p class="i4">Scenery Silver Key  = 900 pts.</p>

<p class="i4">Scenery Bronze Key  = 800 pts.</p>

<p class="i4">Scenery Brass Key   = 700 pts.</p>

<p class="i4">Scenery Bag of Gold = 100 pts.</p>


<p class="i1"><u>Brigand Sequence</u></p>

<p class="i2">The brigand sequence begins when the player opens a brigand box.  The player is drawn into the box and must fight for the warrior survival.  
The player must destroy a randomly determined number of brigands (up to about 20 brigands).  If the warrior is successful (kills all the brigands), then 
the player may receive a randomly selected treasure (see below).</p>

<p class="i2">If the warrior is killed, the player is returned to the forest outside of the brigand box.  If the player is feeling brave, the brigand box 
may be attempted again.  The player may enter the box as often as warriors are available.</p>

<p class="i2">Under certain conditions, the last brigand may flee the box instead of fighting.  If this happens, the brigand sequence is still over.  
This should be a rare condition and represents a programming problem that could take a long time to fix.</p>

<p class="i2">The brigands throw most of the flamoids directly at the player, but some are thrown randomly (hoping that the warrior will move into them, 
while trying to evade the directed flamoids).</p>

<p class="i2">The warrior has an unlimited number of flamoids.</p>

<p class="i2">The warrior cannot be destroyed by his own flamoids.  And the brigands cannot be killed by flamoids thrown by themselves or other 
brigands.</p>

<p class="i2">Control Definitions</p>

<p class="i3">Joystick   =  Moves warrior right or left only</p>

<p class="i3">Button #1  =  Inventory page</p>

<p class="i3">Button #2  =  Throw flamoid left</p>

<p class="i3">Button #3  =  Throw flamoid straight</p>

<p class="i3">Button #4  =  Throw flamoid right</p>


<p class="i2">Scoring</p>

<p class="i3">125 pts. for each brigand destroyed</p>

<p class="i3">Score depends upon treasure found</p>

<p class="i4">New warriors = number of warriors  x  100 pts</p>

<p class="i4">Bags of Gold = number of bags  x  100 pts</p>

<p class="i4">Be Gone      = no points / no treasure</p>


<p class="i1"><u>Magician Sequence</u></p>

<p class="i2">The magician sequence begins when the player opens a magician box.  The player is drawn into the box and is open to the will of the 
magician.  If the player has sufficent gold, a key or other treasure may be granted by the magician (the magician might just tell the warrior to bugger-
off).</p>

<p class="i1"><u>Dark Tower / Riddle of the Keys</u></p>

<p class="i2">The Dark Tower is visible only when all four keys are in the possession of the player.  The Dark Tower is located at the center of the map 
in the largest of the Dark Forests.  This Dark Forest is surrounded by a forest of heavily mixed trees (all four tree types and trees alternate).</p>

<p class="i2">The Riddle of the Keys is entered by walking into the entrance of the Dark Tower (the Dark Tower may not be entered if a fog is pending, if 
the player is backing or turning into the tower).  If the player does not answer the riddle correctly, the player is informed which of the guesses where 
correct and then is thrown back into the forest (the fog mechanism).  If the player has a scout, then the warrior appears outside the Dark Tower for 
another chance (all the conditions for the scout still apply - it can only be used a limited number of times).</p>

<p class="i2">The combination for the Riddle of the Keys is determined randomly at the beginning of the game and does change for the duration of the 
game.  Because of the way that the random number generator functions, certain combinations will occur more often than others and this bias will be 
machine dependent.</p>
