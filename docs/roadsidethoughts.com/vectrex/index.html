<br /><p class="i1">Let me begin with an apology - of sorts.</p>

<p class="i1">I'm John Hall and over 30 years ago, I was hired by Western Technologies to be a member of the Breaker team.  Along with Mark Indictor and 
Paul Allen Newell, we had the task of reverse engineering the Atari&#160;2600, writing our documentation and then creating original 2600&#160;games.  
Paul started the Atari version of Towering Inferno.  Mark started Star Trek.  I began a game called Mutually Assured Destruction&#160;(MAD), which was 
later renamed MAD:&#160;USA&#160;vs.&#160;USSR.  More about Breaker can be found on the 
<a href="http://roadsidethoughts.com/vectrex/breaker-and-the-6502.htm">Project Breaker and the 6502 Vectrex</a> page.</p>

<p class="i1">When Western Technologies found General Consumers Electronics&#160;(GCE) as the investor for Vectrex, the three of us put Breaker on the 
shelf and shifted our focus to the Vectrex.  Even though the design of the Vectrex was still in flux, we began to create our games.  Paul was doing 
Scramble.  Mark did Star Trek.  I began writing Mine Storm, which was intended as the resident game.</p>

<p class="i1">When we finished our games, the three of us resigned from Western Technologies.  Mark and I were later hired by GCE as game designers.  
Paul was retained by Western Technologies as a consultant to finish a game for US Games.</p>

<p class="i1">While at GCE, Mark wrote Spinball, Mail Plane, Tour de France and Polar Rescue.  I wrote Fortress of Narzod and Dark Tower.</p>

<p class="i1">When the Vectrex came to an end, I moved to the Eastern Sierras (with no tv, intermittent phone service and a radio that received just a 
couple of very local stations).  I eventually moved back to the Los Angeles area and returned to engineering by hiring into Teradata's&#160;R&D.</p>

<p class="i1">Starting early in my career, I had a habit where I wrote my own documentation.  Doing so gave me a better idea of what I was trying to 
accomplish.  Sometimes I shared this documentation, but generally I didn't.  It wasn't that I was being selfish or secretive, it's just that my attempt 
at documentation was always incomplete, of low priority and based on my understanding of the moment - which can be shaky at best.</p>

<p class="i1">Moving on from Vectrex and doing a poor job of keeping in touch, I never realized the interest and enthusiasm that continued amongst the 
Vectrex community.  Recently I was asked to help with an article about Dark Tower and while double-checking my answers, I realized that I had squirreled 
away a great deal of information and that there might still be some interest in it.</p>

<p class="i1">For those of you who share an interest in the Vectrex, I want to apologize for not sharing this information with you sooner.  I hope these 
pages from my Vectrex collection makes some sort of amends.</p>

<p class="i1">I should mention that I have moved several times over the last 30 years and I can't be sure of the completeness of what I have placed here.  
I'm afraid that my rat's nest has been stirred many times and I know that some of my boxes have been lost over the years.  With a nod to Pliny, take what 
you find here with a grain of salt.</p>
