<p>Intensity_1F ($F29D)</p>

<p>Intensity_3F ($F2A1)</p>

<p>Intensity_5F ($F2A5)</p>

<p>Intensity_7F ($F2A9)</p>

<p>Intensity_a ($F2AB)</p>

<p>Each of these routines are responsible for setting the
vector/dot intensity (commonly used to denote the z axis) to a
specific value. 0x00 is the lowest intensity, and 0x7F is the
brightest intensity. A negative intensity is also lowest
intensity (7th bit set). The intensity must be reset to the
desired value after each call to Wait_Recal; however, it can also
be changed at any other time. A copy of the new intensity value
is saved in $C827. </p>
