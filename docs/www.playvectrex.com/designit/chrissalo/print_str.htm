<p>Print_Str ($F495)</p>

<p>This is the routine which does the actual printing of a
string. The U register points to the start of the string, while
$C82A contains the height of the character, cell, and $C82B
contains the width of the character cell. The string is
terminated with an 0x80. </p>

<p>The string is displayed by drawing 7 horizontal rows of dots.
The first row is drawn for each character, then the second, etc.
The character generation table is located at ($F9D4 + $20). Only
characters 0x20-0x6F (upper case) are defined; the lower case
characters a-o produce special icons. </p>
