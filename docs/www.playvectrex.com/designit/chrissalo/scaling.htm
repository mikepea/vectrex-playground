<p>The above program also sets the scaling value to 50, which is
still a pretty small scaling value. Vectrex achieves scaling with
a timer. The time for how long a vector is drawn (or just
positioned) is the scale value. Thus (as also mentioned befor)
using high scale factors result in a 'waste' of time. The scaling
factor is set by loading the value directly to the timer of the
VIA 6522 chip, namely register VIA_t1_cnt_lo ($D004). Below you
can find some functions that will set the scaling value while
(befor) postioning the vectorbeam (further below).</p>
