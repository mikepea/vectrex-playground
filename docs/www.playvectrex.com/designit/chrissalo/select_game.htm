<p>Select_Game ($F7A9)</p>

<p>This routine provides a game with the means for allowing the
player to choose the game number he would like to play, and the
number of players. The game indicates the number of game versions
available, by placing the value in the B register. The number of
players allowed is specified in the A register. If a parameter is
passed in with a value of 0, then the corresponding question will
not be asked. The number of players selected is returned in
$C879, while the game number selected is returned in $C87A. </p>

<p>This routine performs most of the work involved in allowing
the player to select a game version and the number of players. It
displays the game # and player options, and allows the player a
certain amount of time to modify their values. Anytime one of the
buttons is used to modify a value, the timer will be restarted.
When a button is pressed, the associated value is modified, and
then redisplayed on the screen. This routine will return when
either the timer expires, or button 4 is pressed. </p>
