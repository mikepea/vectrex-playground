<p><font size="5"><strong>The Vectrex OS and its functions</strong></font></p>

<p>There is no 'official' ROM listing, and therefor there are no
official function names. I learned the inner workings of the
vectrex ROM from a documented dissassembled ROM. As far as I know
there are two such dissassembled listings, one done by Fred Taft
and one by Bruce Tomlin (based on Freds work). Throughout this
document I use the function names given in Bruce's version.<br>

<p><strong>Many thanks for the nice job you both have done.</strong><br>

<p>The OS is located at memory address $F000 to $FFFF (well
nearly, the last few bytes are reserved vectors of the 6809 CPU).
Most functions require parameters, some functions return some
values. This information is most of the time passed via registers
of the 6809 microproccessor. There is no 'standard' in what
registers are used. Look at the functions for the information
which registers are used. As you will know the 6809 CPU has a
register called DP (direct page register), this register is used
to point to 256byte pages within the memory. The 6809 can address
256*256byte pages, dp therefor can have values from 0-255. The dp
register if used wisely can shorten and speedup programs, because
direct page accesses are faster and shorter than extended
addressing. There are two values that you will encounter
frequently while programming vectrex, as $c8 and $d0. You can
see, eyeing the memory map above, these are direct page pointers
to 1. ($c8) RAM used by the BIOS (or the programmer) and 2. ($d0)
the base address of the VIA 6522 (VIA Vercatile Interface
Adapter, sometimes called PIA Periphal Interface Adapter). All
output and timer functionality are regulated/accessed by that
chip, it is pretty important :-). For a detailed describtion of
that chip see Appendix C. Actually input is also done via VIA,
but indirectly, by accessing the AY-3-8912 soundchip, see
Appendix D for a detailed describtion of that chip.<br>
